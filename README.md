# Drawing App Project

This is an Angular web application that I developed along with four other developers as a school project. I mainly worked on:

- Text tool
- Stamp tool
- Eye Dropper
- Color picker (bottom left)

# See it in action

You can use the app by following this link: [https://thomas-bergeron.github.io/Drawing-App/](thomas-bergeron.github.io/Drawing-App/)

Please note that the back-end is not deployed on this version.
